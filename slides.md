# Agenda

- Intro
- Fantom
- Frege
- Ioke
- Common Lisp
- Outro
- Discussion

# Why Different Languages?

- Java has evolved: Once a fringe language for *applets* on the web, now a full-fledged ecosystem
- JVM is a sophisticated and performant runtime abstracting away from (most of) the gory hardware details
- Java The Language has not evolved as much as the Java The Platform
- Class-Based Statically-Typed Object-Orientation is *One* paradigm of programming
- Some languages are closer to some problems expression than other

# Goal of this Talk

- To instill the desire of discovering different programming paradigms
- To provide introductory materials on those different paradigms
- To get ouf of our comfort zone
- To have fun!

# Fantom: A better Java

# Fantom

# Frege: Haskell on the JVM

![](frege.jpg)

# Frege

- A clone of [Haskell](http://haskell.org) on the JVM
- A Pure Non-strict Statically-Typed Functional language: Rich type system, Functions everywhere, Powerful abstractions and combinations capabilities
- Targets newest JVM (JDK 7)
- Uses Eclipse as IDE through a dedicated plugin

# Ioke: Prototypes Everywhere

# Common Lisp: More Parens

# Common Lisp

- Common Lisp is one flavour of Lisp which is standardized
- Recall that Lisp is the ancestor of all modern languages 
- Everything is a list, Powerful macros, Rich ecosystem, Multi-paradigms programming (OO, functional, imperative), DSL-ready, Lots of Parenthesis

# Common Lisp - Getting Started

- Download [Armed Bear Common Lisp](http://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/) distribution which contains a self-standing jar
- Best programming experience combines [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (Lisp-aware editor) + [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/) (package manager) + [Slime](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) (generic Lisp environment for Emacs)
- To be more mainstream, you might want to try [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)
