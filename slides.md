# Introduction

# Why Different Languages?

- Java has evolved: Once a fringe language for *applets* on the web, now a full-fledged ecosystem
- JVM is a sophisticated and performant runtime abstracting away from (most of) the gory hardware details
- Java The Language has not evolved as much as the Java The Platform
- Class-Based Statically-Typed Object-Orientation is *One* paradigm of programming
- Some languages are closer to some problems expression than other
